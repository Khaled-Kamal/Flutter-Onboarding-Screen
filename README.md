#Flutter Onboarding Screen

A new template

## Description
An Onboarding Screen in Flutter is the first set of screens that a user sees when they open an app for the first time. It helps introduce the app’s features, guide users, and encourage them to take action, like signing up or starting a trial.

✅ Why Use Onboarding Screens?
* Introduce Key Features – Show users what your app offers.
* Improve User Engagement – A good first impression keeps users interested.
* Guide New Users – Help them understand the app’s functionality.
* Encourage Action – Direct them to sign up or log in.

## 📌 Steps to Create an Onboarding Screen in Flutter
1️⃣ Add Dependencies (Optional)
You can create an onboarding screen from scratch, but if you prefer a package, you can use introduction_screen. Add it to your pubspec.yaml:
